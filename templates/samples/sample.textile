<br />
<br />
Notes are visible in "printer view":test.pdf.html (no auto-id anchor support
when using @textile@ source)

<div class='notes'>

# first point
# second point
# third one...

h2. Yes we can do formated text inside notes!

</div>

h1. Google Code Prettify usage

h2. Original vs. Prettier

<pre>
#!/bin/sh -e
read -s -p "Password: " passwd
echo
if [ -f "$0" ];then
  sleep 2
fi
echo "You typed '$passwd'"
</pre>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'highline/import'
pass = ask("Password: ") do |q|
 q.echo = "‚óè"
end
puts "Password is '#{pass}'."
</pre>

<br />

bq. **Press <span class="key">H</span> or <span class="key">B</span> to toggle

!TRANSITION z-section

h2. Transition slide

Level 2 title becomes transition slide title, but watch the following image...

!../Z.png(Z image)!

h1. One page on "z-section"

Now see how previous transition slide image is repeated without any additional
code...

h1. Another page on "z-section"

h2. Be warned: the "logo" is a shadow of the original image

p=. !../Z.png(Z image)!

And bottom image/log can be reseted using a transition slide without any
image....

!TRANSITION y-section

h2. Transition slide without image

Only a subtitle, let's see what's happen on following pages...

h1. One page on "y-section"

There is no image at bottom of this page...

h1. Another page on "y-section"

... nor at this one too.

!TRANSITION

h2. Thanks for reading!

Now some junk...
